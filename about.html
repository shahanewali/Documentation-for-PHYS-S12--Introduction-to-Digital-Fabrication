### 
<h4><b>About Me</b></h4>

<p class="aboutme">My name is Shahane. I am 22 years olds and I am from Paris,France. I have a double degree in engineering (Energy and environment) and business management(Supply chain and purchasing management). 
I am not familiar with digital fabrication. This is out of my comfort zone but I was really curious about this course and I want to be able to create something.
So a bit about myself: I like dancing, listening to music, reading. I am into art and fashion. You will always find me in an exhibition on the weekends! I don't really know what else to say </p>

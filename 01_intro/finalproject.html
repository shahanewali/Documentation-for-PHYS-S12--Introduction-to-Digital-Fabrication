<h2>Final project</h2>

<h2>Introduction and project goals</h2>

An issue that I have is that I have tons of coins.
<img src="coins.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:200px;height:350px;"/>

This is a plastic bag full of coins that I have at home (I have many other coins in my bedroom, purses..). I think I have at least 50 euros in this bag. 
The problem is that I never use the coins I have. The thought of having to sort and count them gives me a headache. I'm too lazy to do it. So, I thought of a smart piggy bank that would sort the coins automatically. Pennies with pennies, quarters with quarters...

This would also tell you how much money you have in total and also per category. It would tell you how many dollars you have with your quarters for example.

It would also be possible to withdraw money by saying how much you'd like to withdraw, specifying whether you'd prefer pennies, etc., depending on your needs.

I got the idea from thinking about the product I had come up with for an entrepreneurial course. It was a smart trash can that we called TrashScan that could recognize any kind of waste and sort it accordingly. Creating such a trash can would require an enormous amount of training in waste recognition. I tried to think of something else and it was with this automatic sorting system in mind that I came up with the idea of a smart piggy bank.

<h2>How to make it?</h2>
<p>Here are some inspirations.</p>
<img src="coinsinspiration.png" alt="Image" style="width:550px;height:350px;"/>
<img src="coinsinspiration2.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:550px;height:350px;"/>
<p>For coin sorting, I want to do it mechanically, with a sort of ramp with different-sized holes for the coins to fall through.
I want my piggy bank to be a box that's not completely closed. I want the coins to be visible, like in the photo above. For the couting part, I will need IR sensors and a LCD screen.
I will first prototype it on cardboard and then use wood probably.</p>

<h2>Bill of materials</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>Arduino Uno</li>
  <li>Piezo discs</li>
  <li>1Mega Ohms resistors </li>
  <li>Wood</li>
  <li>Wires</li>
  <li>3 LCD screens</li>
  <li>Breadboard</li>
<p>I'm still not sure what the inside of my piggy bank is going to look like. There's already the size of the circuit involved, for example. Here are some schematics I have in mind.</p>
<img src="dessinporjetfinal.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:400px;height:400px;"/> 

</ul>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First week of July: getting started on the project</li>
  <li>Second week of July: Printing some 3D parts and coding</li>
  <li>Third week of July: Printing all 3D parts required, working on building the piggy bank </li>
  <li>Fourth week of July: Soldering? Finishing the code and the piggy bank</li>
  <li>Last minute: rechecking everything</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>JULY 5<h2>
  <p>I started working on the final project. I had already been working on it at home but it was my first day using the lab.</p>
  <p>At home, I first tried to design the box but I realised I would need to know how much space the sensors would take for example.</p>
 <p>I started by making the ramp and then see if there were some IR sensors at the lab to start getting familiar with it.</p>
   <p>To make the ramp, I first looked up the diameters of the various parts on the Internet.</p>
   <img src="diametrepieceswikipedia.png" alt="Image" style="width:400px;height:400px;"/> 
   <p>On my ramp, I've sorted the diameters from smallest to largest. First the 10-cent coins, then the 1-cent coins, the 5-cent coins, the 25-cent coins, the 1-dollar coins and the 50-cent coins. (Apparently, the 50 centimes are very rare, so for the moment I'm assuming they don't exist.This doesn't change anything to my ramp, since they're at the very end, so I don't need to make a hole like for the others. As for the circuit and coding, I'll add a sensor if necessary).UPDATE: Apparently, it's more of a collector's item and there aren't many of them in circulation so I won't be needing another sensor.</p>
   <p>At first, I wanted to make rounds with a slightly larger diameter, but I figured rectangles would be safer for the pieces to fall into. I laser cut the ramp, and it was not really a success as the laser cutter cut too much so the coins weren't going were there were supposed to go. I've done some more tests, but I haven't found the perfect ramp yet. I am also not sure how much space I should leave between the holes because I don't know yet where my sensors will be or the size of each "mini piggy bank" depending on the sorting of the coins.</p>
  <img src="sortingcoinssketchfusion360.png" alt="Image" style="width:700px;height:300px;"/>
  <p>Here is a video of my ramp so far. It still doesn't work very well, as the 1-cent coins fall into the dime hole. But I am working on it.</p>
    <video width="300" height="600" controls>
      <source src="Rampprototypev1.mp4" type=video/mp4>
    </video>
   <p> I really wanted to focus on the sensors so I tried different options.
    None of them really worked out. I first used a mini PIR sensor which was not precise at all. I then tried to create a DIY IR sensor with an IR transmitter and IR receiver.</p>
<ul> 
  <li>Arduino Uno</li>
  <li>IR transmitter</li>
  <li>IR Receiver </li>
  <li>Resistors 220 Ohm </li>
  <li>Wires</li>
  <li>LED</li>
  <li>Potentiometer</li>
  <li>Breadboard</li>
</ul>
<img src="circuitIRsensorsDIY.png" alt="Image" style="width:550px;height:400px;"/>
<p>Here is the result that is not very conclusive. Sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't. I am not really happy with this solution.</p>

<p>I have found IR sensors online that I think would help me. I would need 6 sensors and with DIY ones I don't see how I can fit them in my piggy bank.</p>
<img src="IRsensorsamazon.png" alt="Image" style="width:400px;height:400px;"/>
<p> I'm a bit disappointed with the day because things didn't go as well as I'd hoped. I feel like I'm still in the same place and I haven't made any progress. I'm afraid I'll never be able to make that piggy bank.</p>

<h2>JULY 11 & 12<h2>
<p>I continued to make prototypes of the ramp to sort the coins with the laser cutter to try and find the perfect size, knowing that the laser cutter always cuts a little more. I especially had a problem with the first hole. The 1-cent coin kept falling into it.
Here are the measures I used that finally worked.</p>
<img src="perfectsizinglasercuttersortingcoins.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:800px;height:300px;"/>
<p>I added an inclined plane on one side of the ramp to make sure that the pieces fall in the right place so I needed to 3D print my ramp. This is part of my week 5 assignment (details on this page).</p>
<img src="finalsortingcoins3Dprint.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:400px;height:500px;"/>
<p>Today, we learnt about sensors so I have decided to try another type of sensors for my final project: piezo discs.
I think this is a good idea and that this will work better than the DIY IR sensors.I started with one sensor and I coded on Arduino so that I would print "coin detected" if it "felt" something. It worked well even for the smallest coins.</p>
<p>Then, I added another piezo disc to my circuit and connected it to another pin on the Arduino board. I changed my code so that it would print "coin detected 1" when a coin fell on it and "coin detected 2" when a coin fell on the other one.Again, it worked really well. I even tried to simulate the fall from the sorting ramp.</p>
<p>Here is the material, the circuit and the codes I used.</p>
<ul> 
  <li>Arduino Uno </li>
  <li>Piezo discs </li>
  <li>Alligator clips</li>
  <li>Breadboard</li>
  <li>Wires</li>

<p>At the same time, I thought about the structure of my piggy bank. First of all, I'm going to need some ramps to make it easier for the coins to fall. The ramp will be less inclined at the beginning, and that's where the sensors will be placed. I've modeled this on Fusion 360. Now, I have several solutions. Either I print 6 ramps directly with 3D printing, which allows me to make 6 holes in the ramps and make them hollow so I can pass the disc wires through the holes and hide all the wires under the ramps. The problem with this solution is that it's going to take a long time to print. It also means that the ramps have to be bigger, so that there's enough room underneath. Alternatively, I use the laser cutter on cardboard or wood and glue several pieces together to create ramps. In this case, I won't make any holes, but instead I'll have 1 second box glued to the back of my piggy bank (in which I'll have made holes) where I'll put all the wires. </p>
<p>Here's the modeling I've done so far, and also a prototype I made using the laser cutter. I don't think there'll be enough room underneath for a whole circuit.</p>

<img src="photoprototyperampe1.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:400px;height:350px;"/>
<p>I also thought of making funnels to make sure that the parts reached the sensors. I 3D printed a prototype.everything works fine with the funnel, ramp and sensors. Having said that, maybe I can improve the funnels so that they fit better around the part that's going to sort the money.</p>

<p>I'm still working on how I'm going to make my piggy bank on the ramps, the funnels, where the parts will be, how to place my sensors and the circuit. Right now, I'm a bit anxious about it. I also need to think about walls to separate each compartment I think I'll make an explanatory diagram like I did for my kinetic sculpture.</p>
<p>As I'm REALLY PANICKED about this aspect I've decided to concentrate on getting the code to work for the 6 sensors for now.</p>

<h2>JULY 13</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, I want to concentrate on the code. So I spent several hours on the subject today. First, I went back to my codes from yesterday (see above), when I'd managed to code for 2 sensors that a coin was detected. So I did the same thing, but with 5 sensors this time.</p>
<p>It worked very well. The problem was that I realized that the circuit took up a lot of space. I'll see about that later.</p>

<p> I then moved on to counting. I started by associating one coin with one sensor. I did this in the order of my ramp:</p>
<ul> 
  <li>Sensor 1: 10 cents</li>
  <li>Sensor 2: 1 cent</li>
  <li>Sensor 3: 5 cents</li>
  <li>Sensor 4: 25 cents</li>
  <li>Sensor 5: 1 dollar</li>
</ul>
<p>I created a total that would print everytime a sensor is "on".I first tested for one sensor, then 2, then all 5. I'm not going to put the 3 codes each time since it's the same thing.</p>
<p>Here's the code for 2 sensors.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-arduino">
const int sensor1Pin = A4;    // Digital pin for sensor 1
const int sensor2Pin = A2;    // Digital pin for sensor 2

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);        // Initialize serial communication at 9600 baud

  pinMode(sensor2Pin, INPUT);// Configure sensor 2 pin as input

  int sensor2Value = digitalRead(sensor2Pin);  // Read the state of sensor 2

  if (sensor1Value == HIGH) {
    Serial.println("Coin detected 1");
    cents += 10;             // Add 10 cents for each sensor 1 detection
    Serial.print("Total: ");
    Serial.print(cents);
    Serial.println(" cents");
    delay(500);              // Wait for 500 milliseconds to debounce
  }

  if (sensor2Value == HIGH) {
    Serial.println("Coin detected 2");
    cents += 1;              // Add 1 cent for each sensor 2 detection
    Serial.print("Total: ");
    Serial.print(cents);

<p>For the rest of the code, I just modified the if loops according to the sensor.At this stage, I hadn't yet coded the conversion to dollars once you pass 100 cents. For the if loop on the 1 dollar sensor I just put + 100 cents on each activation. So my total was only in cents.</p>
<p>Then, I wanted to add local totals for each sensor and have my conversion in dollars. That is, if I press sensor 3 for the 3rd time and I already have 1 dollar in my piggy bank, I see in the serial monitor:</p>
<ul> 
  <li>Total 3= 15 cents</li>
  <li>Total= 1 dollar and 5 cents</li>

  <p>I'm very happy with this code, now the next step is to succeed in using an output. I'll probably use an LCD screen.</p>

<h2>JULY 13 part 2: LED discovery</h2>
<p>Yesterday, in class, we learnt about output devices. During the lab, I tried to use OLED screens and then moved on to LCD screens. I wanted my piggy bank totals to be displayed on this screen.</p>
<p>I began by using the LCD on its own. Here's the wiring I followed:</p>
<img src="LCDmontageessai1.png" alt="Image" style="width:500px;height:450px;"/>
<p>I then tried to print things on the LED screen. In particular, I tried printing 1c, 5c, 10c, 25c, $1 and a sigma on the first line, and zeros underneath on the second line. I wanted to see if everything I wanted to display would fit. The answer was no. A 16x2 LCD screen is too small.</p>

<p>Finally, I decided that for the time being I would only print the total amount.</p>

<h2> JULY 14 </h2>
<p>After experimenting with the LCD screen yesterday, I wanted to try and get it to return the result of the Piezo discs counting code I made yesterday. I can only get it to return the global total at the moment, as there isn't enough space on the LCD screen otherwise.</p>
<p>Here is the circuit and the code.</p>

<h2>JULY 15 </h2>
<h2>Part1:Coding</h2>
Yesterday, I realised that it was possible to use I2C LCD screens which are much more easier to connect. This is the circuit.
<img src="schemacircuit1LCDI2C.png" alt="Image" style="width:300px;height:200px;"/>
<p>First, I did what I did before to understand how an I2C LCD worked. I had to download the library and look at the different commands.To adjust contrast, you just need to use the potentiometer on the I2C with a screwdriver. A normal LCD and I2C screen don't initialize the same way for example.<p>
<p>I tried this code.</p>
 <pre>
  <code class="language-arduino">
#include "Wire.h"
#include "LiquidCrystal_I2C.h"

LiquidCrystal_I2C LCD(0x27,16,2);

<p>I also I learnt that I could use multiple I2C LCDs at the same time which will be useful to display all the informations. In order to use multiple I2C LCD, it is necessary to change the I2C adress.
<img src="changeI2Cadress.png" alt="Image" style="width:500px;height:400px;"/>
<p>To check the address of an I2C, there's a function available in the Arduino examples. Before I changed my addresses, the 3 I2Cs had the address 0x27.</p>
<p>Kassia helped me with this task. (Thank you Kassia)</p>
<img src="I2CLCDnewaddress.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:400px;height:400px;"/>
<p>Thanks to the I2C scanner function, I've obtained my new addresses: 0x26 (A0 bridged) and 0x23(A2 bridged).</p>
<p>Now it is possible to use all 3 at the same time.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Building</h2>
<p> I printed my first toboggan prototype with the 3D printer after making it with a laser cutter and tested it to see if it worked.</p>
<img src="toboggan3Dprintedv1.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:400px;height:500px;"/>
<p>I tested with the code that displays the total on the LCD screen. It works very well.(Video below) However, I noted that I could make a few modifications to the slide, which I did in fusion 360. I then ran a 3D print again.</p>

<p> Now, I will explain the vision that I have for my 3 LCDs. I want to display the same thing as my serial monitor. I.e. the total in dollars of 1 cent coins, 5 cent coins etc. as well as the number of coins that have been put in. Of course, I also want the total of all coins. Given that I want a lot of information displayed and that I have a limited number of slots, I need to use 3 LCD screens.</p>
<p>On each screen there will be 2 groups of information.</p>
<p>On the first screen there will be information related to 1 cent and 5 cents coins.</p>
<p>On the second screen, there will be information related to 10 cents and 25 cents coins.</p>
<p>Finally, on the last screen, there will be information related to 1-dollar coins and the total amount.</p>
<p>I want it to be displayed this way. On the first line, I want it to say 1c,5c etc., with the number of coins in the piggy bank in brackets next to it. On the second line, I want the corresponding dollar total.</p>
<p>For example, if 3 coins of 5 cents have fallen into the piggy bank, it must be marked on screen number 2 on the first line 5c(3) and on the second $0.15.</p>
<p>I hope it's clear, but in any case the pictures will speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Now, for the code, I first tested it on 2 screens: on the first, the information for the 1-cent and 5-cent coins, and on the second, the overall total.</p>

<h2>JULY 17 & 18 </h2>
<h2> Part 1: Coding</h2>
<p>I am very happy with all the programming I did but now I have to do OOP.</p>
<p> I could have coded directly with classes and no delay but this is really something I hate. I learnt Java in my engineering school and I hated it, I am much more comfortable with Python. I guess I wanted to save the worst part for the end.:))</p>
<p> For my week 7 assigment, I had to work on making a clean code. I didn't work on my final code but on the one that allowed me to display the total amount in the piggy bank on one LCD screen.</p>

<p> Next step is to work on making a cleaner final code.. Can't wait! </p>

<h2>Part 2: Building </h2>
<p> With my final code and my new 3D printed slides, I prototyped my piggy bank.</p>
<video width="500" height="700" controls>
      <source src="test1.0final.mp4" type=video/mp4>
    </video>
<p> It worked perfectly so now I need to 3D print the rest of my slides. I am not sure that I will be needing funnels.</p>

<h2>JULY 19</h2>
<p> I 3D printed all of my slides. There were a few printing defects, but nothing serious.</p>

<h2>JULY 20</h2>
<p>Today, I printed out the walls that will separate each slide and compartment. I modeled them after the slide sketch.</p>
<p>I also spent a good part of the day working to make the code cleaner with classes.
I also had a new idea to add a new sensor to act as a reset button. It resets everything to 0 when you empty the piggy bank.</p>

<p>There's a video below showing everything in action.</p>

<h2>JULY 21</h2>
<p>Now that I've printed out everything I need and have my circuit with working code, I wanted to move on to assembling the piggy bank.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was screw the walls to my slides.</p>
<img src="tobogganmurvissé.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:400px;height:500px;"/>
<p>I then wanted to move on to the box. But first I wanted to check that the circuit would fit under the slides, and I also wanted to see how much space the breadboard and arduino would take up in my piggy bank.</p>
<p>It took me a lot longer than expected because the piezo disks kept breaking and the soldering didn't hold.</p>
<p>After a while, I managed to prototype the inside of my piggy bank.</p>
<img src="prototypefinalfinalproject.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:400px;height:500px;"/>
<p>I then took measurements to find out how big my box should be.</p>
<p>Here's a drawing of my piggy bank with dimensions.</p>
<img src="dessinboitedelatirelire.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:500px;height:515px;"/>


<h2>JULY 23</h2>
<p>Today, I continued assembling my piggy bank. I started printing the box. I used the Makercase website. 
I also screwed my sorting ramp to the box and started attaching the slides.</p>

<h2>JULY 24</h2>
<p>I worked on the piggy bank assembly again today. I screwed on all the slides and printed the left side of the box, remembering to add a slot for the coins.
I also took the opportunity to retest my code to make sure everything was working properly.</p>

<h2>JULY 25 & 26</h2>
<p>Between yesterday and today, I imrpimed the front of my piggy bank with holes for LCD screens. I screwed my "screens" to my piggy bank. I also screwed my arduino board to the inside right-hand side of my piggy bank.
I printed a little pig in 3D.<p>

  <a download href='./Piggy_0.2mm_PLA_MK3S_4h58m'>Download my gcode file</a>
<p>I also realized that there was a problem with my compartment walls: they don't all touch the floor of the piggy bank, so the coins get mixed up and they don't reach the end of the piggy bank. There's about 1cm between the end of the "walls" and the end of the piggy bank.</p>
<p>To alleviate this problem, I decided to print some sort of clamps with the 3D printer.I took measurements of the thickness, height and length of my "walls" to make my clamp.</p>

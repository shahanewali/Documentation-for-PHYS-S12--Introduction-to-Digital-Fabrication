#### Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting

<i> Assignment:
Create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways, and accounts for lasercutter kerf.
Examples: Kassia's triangles, Chris's pencil holder, Kian's Moose
Work through a Fusion 360 tutorial, like this or some of these (or similar if you are using other software) and document what you produce.
Select at least 2 household objects or components from the lab (could be items you think you might include in your final project). Measure them using calipers, and model them in Fusion 360 (or other program). Create an assembly using these components, and document your work on your webpage. You may also incorporate items from other 3D model repositories like GrabCad. </i>

This week, we learnt laser and vinyl cutting and we had a demo on blender and Fusion 360.

As I have previously mentionned, I know how to use Solidworks which is similar to Fusion 360. So when I saw the assignemnt at first I wasn't worried. Let me tell you that I was WRONG! My Solidworks skills left my body and I had to relearn to use a 3D modeling software from scratch. I did it a bit solo and I also followed the Fusion 360 tutorials. Luckily, as I got used to Fusion 360, I remembered how to use this type of software (the basics at least).
To complete the assignement, I didn't really know what to make so I figured I would just print some random pieces. I struggled at first because of fusion 360 but mostly because of the laser cutting part and I had some failed printings. 
I decided to keep the simple square we all kind off "had to" make to build my press-kit.
Here it is on Fusion 360:

 Then I decided to use arcs to have another shape. To do this, I drew 2 circles on Fusion 360 with 2 different diameters. I then drew a small rectangle between the 2 circles. I then used circular pattern to make 4 cut-outs around the circles, as for the square. This gave me 4 arcs at once. 
Here are some photos of the construction on Fusion 360.

#### Week 1: Introduction and final project idea

<i> Assignment:
Create a website and make a page with a proposal for a possible final project. Send a link with your website to your section TA. </i>

This is my first website ever! Coding is not my thing so I am pretty happy about this :)
About the final project, seeing all the amazing ideas the others had made me really nervous. I have never created anything whatsoever so I hope I will be good at this. I have only used Solidworks in my life if that counts as creativity.
So here is my idea

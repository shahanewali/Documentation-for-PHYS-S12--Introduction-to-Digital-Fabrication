#### Week 1: Introduction and final project idea

<i> Assignment:
Create a website and make a page with a proposal for a possible final project. Send a link with your website to your section TA. </i><br><i>(Here is a <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/01_intro/index.html">Link to the original assignment page </a>) </i>

This is my first website ever! Coding is not my thing so I am pretty happy about this :) I mean I know how to code in Python and a bit in Java but I have never used HTML which makes it even more complicated for someone allergic to code like me.
I hope I will be able to improve my website throughout the course. 
About the final project, I have never created anything whatsoever so I hope I will be good at this. I have only used Solidworks in my life if that counts as creativity?


An issue that I have is that I have tons of coins.

This is a plastic bag full of coins that I have at home (I have many other coins in my bedroom, purses..). I think I have at least 50 euros in this bag. 
The problem is that I never use the coins I have. The thought of having to sort and count them gives me a headache. I'm too lazy to do it. So, I thought of a smart piggy bank that would sort the coins automatically. Pennies with pennies, quarters with quarters...

This would also tell you how much money you have in total and also per category. It would tell you how many dollars you have with your quarters for example.

It would also be possible to withdraw money by saying how much you'd like to withdraw, specifying whether you'd prefer pennies, etc., depending on your needs.

I got the idea from thinking about the product I had come up with for an entrepreneurial course. It was a smart trash can that we called TrashScan that could recognize any kind of waste and sort it accordingly. Creating such a trash can would require an enormous amount of training in waste recognition. I tried to think of something else and it was with this automatic sorting system in mind that I came up with the idea of a smart piggy bank.

I hope this is clear. 
Since I have no experience, I have no idea on how to proceeds but I will figure it out :)

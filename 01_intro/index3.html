#### Week 3: Electronics and Tools

<i> Assignment:
Create a kinetic sculpture. Include circuitry to move your sculpture.
Use a multimeter to measure the voltages in your circuit. Use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit.
Document your work and learning. Include at least one video/gif of your sculpture. </i>
And here is a <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/03_tools/index.html">Link to the original assignment page</a>

<p> This week, I was really motivated to make something nice and I wanted to challenge myself a bit. I went through some ideas online and finally I chose to do a kinetic figure like this.</p>

<p>So, I first started to modelise the spiral on Fusion360. Actually, I didn't follow any tutorials and I did it by myself.</p>
<p> For the process, I first drew a circle and then I added the cut outs by using arcs. For the first half of the spiral, I used a construction circle and I also built a triangle to fit the cut out. Finally, I reproduced 10 times the cut out accross the circle with "circular pattern". For the measurements, since I didn't follow any tutorials, I just used what I thought would work.</p>

<p> Once I was done with the spiral, I realised that I had no idea how to motorise them. I spent some time thinking on how I would build my kinetic sculpture. I thought of many different things and I finally made my mind. Here is a drawing of my idea.</p>

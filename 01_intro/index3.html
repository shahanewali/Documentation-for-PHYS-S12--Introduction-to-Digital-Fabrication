#### Week 3: Electronics and Tools

<i> Assignment:
Create a kinetic sculpture. Include circuitry to move your sculpture.
Use a multimeter to measure the voltages in your circuit. Use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit.
Document your work and learning. Include at least one video/gif of your sculpture. </i>

    </video>
